<p><h3><strong>RANKED CHOICE VOTING OPTIONS: Score Runoff is new and improved Instant Runoff Voting</strong></h3>

<div id="IRV"></div>
Traditional Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) is one of many forms of Ranked Choice Voting that use a preference order ballot: first choice, second choice, third choice and so on.</p>

<p>Because full rank ordering makes for a complex ballot, IRV proponents typically advocate a limit of three or four choices on the ballot. An example ballot might look like this:

<p><img src="IRV_ballot.png" alt="IRV_ballot.png" /></p>

<p><strong>The Rules</strong>

<p>Both IRV and the newer SRV have a final runoff round to determine the winner. What differentiates the two system is how they determine which candidates are present in the final vote.

<p>In IRV, the final contestants are determined by successively eliminating the candidate with the fewest first-choice votes amongst the voters. With each elimination, the votes of those who chose the eliminated candidate in top position transfer to the next choice on the ballot, until the final instant runoff that gives one candidate a majority of first choice votes amongst the ballots that remain.

<p><strong>Metrics For Comparison</strong>

<p>Equal.Vote evaluates voting systems according to five primary criteria: <strong>equality, accuracy, simplicity, expressiveness, and honesty</strong>. The narrative below compares Instant Runoff and Score Runoff voting according to these five metrics.

<div class="gray-box">
<br>
<strong>Equality:</strong> Is every vote equally powerful, regardless of the location of the voter or the popularity of their prefered candidate? 
<br><br>
</div>

<p>Our current system is full of issues of vote inequality ranging from gerrymandering to the electoral collage. The old overly complicated Instant Runoff Voting system addressed those issues but had another problem: The people's choice didn't consistently win. The winner can actually vary depending on which order you eliminate the losing candidates and you still have to be strategic in order to not waste your vote. 

<p>Score Runoff Voting passes the test of equality. (add link) You rank all the candidates in the order you prefer them by giving each a score. The two with the highest total scores make it to the final runoff. Your ballot already shows which of those finalists you prefer and they will ultimately get your full vote. There is no risk of wasting your vote. 

<div class="gray-box">
<br>
<strong>Accuracy:</strong> How accurately does the voting system reflect the will of the people?
<br><br>
</div>

<p>Ideally a voting system will always elect the candidate that will make most people as happy as possible. We call this winner The Peoples Choice. In some cases this will be a simple majority or in elections where there are multiple options there may be a compromise candidate. The Peoples Choice is the candidate that would win in a head to head election against any others. 

<p>(Include an awesome video or visual aid here) For example: lets say we are choosing what to serve for snack. Most voters don't like Broccoli at all and prefer a Fruit, and they'd be happy with apples or pears. Broccoli gets 35%, Apples gets 33%, Pears get 32%. Even though Broccoli got more votes right off the bat most voters actually prefer Fruit and even the people who like Broccoli prefer Apples to Pears. Apples should win.

<p>Our current system, Plurality Voting, often splits either the left or right vote if there is a 3rd party in the general election. This creates a spoiler effect. Introducing a runoff helps but Instant Runoff Voting can also have a spoiler effect because in the first round IRV only looks at people first choices and ignores the rest of the information on voters ballots. Recent work by Robert Norman, a mathematician at Dartmouth, suggests that in more than 1 in 5 elections with 3 or more candidates IRV can elect a candidate that is not The Peoples Choice. That is a failure rate of over 20%! 

<p>Score Runoff Voting looks at how much support each candidate has all at once and then uses that big picture perspective to narrow it down to the top two. This is much more accurate. When all the leading election systems are analyzed (link to color dot graph) for accuracy Score Runoff Voting comes out at the top of the list and knocks Plurality and IRV out of the ballpark.

<br>
<strong>Simplicity:</strong> Is the system easy to understand and user friendly for both voters and elections officials, even if there needs to be a hand recount?
<br><br>
</div>

<p>The mechanism for counting votes in IRV can be extremely confusing because it often takes many rounds before a majority winner is found. Steve Pond <a href="http://www.thewrap.com/awards/column-post/dont-believe-schmucks-24542/">wrote the following</a> about IRV after its adoption as the voting system for choosing Best Picture by the Motion Picture Academy: "A year and a half after the Academy went to a different system for counting Best Picture ballots, <strong>nominees and voters and campaigners still don't understand how it works.</strong> And it's driving me crazy."

<p>Because IRV's counting algorithm goes through one round for each losing candidate until a winner is decided, elections can take many rounds to compute. The image below represents a sample election vote tally in the multi-round IRV process. It's hard for observers and lay voters to draw meaningful conclusions about voter preferences from these intermediate results:

<p><img src="IRV_results.png" alt="IRV_results.png" /></p>
<p>Score Runoff Voting is simple to tabulate. It is always completed in two rounds with transparent results that show overall popular support for every candidate. You can see the election results of the sample election run with SRV below:
<p><img src="SRV_results_vs_IRV.png" alt="SRV_results_vs_IRV.png" /></p>

<p>The winner of an IRV election cannot be tabulated until all ballot information is reported to a central location. Maine, which just passed IRV, is dealing with the <a href="http://www.pressherald.com/2016/11/11/logistics-could-put-ranked-choice-voting-on-hold-in-2018/">headaches of this system now</a>, expecting that "ballots would have to be shipped by town clerks to a central location in Augusta for additional voting rounds. Thus the outcome of an election in a multiple-candidate race might not be known for several weeks." Essentially, each town clerk has to come up with all of the many possible combinations of rank orderings and report the total for each, in order that the central counting authority can begin the process to determine the winner. These partial results give little meaningful information to the voters. A small subset of one election's partial results in IRV might look like this:</p>

<p><img src="IRV_precinct.png" alt="IRV_precinct.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Score Runoff Voting results can be summed by precinct</strong>, both the overall score as well as the preference totals for each candidate pair. This gives information that is useful in understanding how the local electorate felt about the election and makes the results easier to verify by hand-recount:

<div class="gray-box">
<br>
<strong>Expressiveness:</strong> Can the voter express a nuanced opinion of each candidate and will that data actually be used? 
<br><br>
</div>

<p>Our current voting system, where we are limited to picking a single favorite in each election, is the least expressive voting system humans have ever constructed. Instant Runoff Voting allows the voter to express an opinion on multiple candidates by placing them in preference order. Still, preference order alone leaves out a ton of information. For example, the same ordering <strong>A > B > C</strong> could mean that the voter thinks A is an awesome candidate, B is mediocre and C is the devil incarnate or that A is awesome, B is almost as awesome, and C is just a hair less awesome than A and B. Furthermore while IRV lets you express support for more than one candidate, it doesn't actually count that secondary support at all until your first choice candidate is eliminated.

<p>Score Runoff Voting has a <strong>more expressive ballot</strong>. Instead of limiting the voter to ranking a fixed number of candidates, SRV allows the voter to express a nuanced level of support for any number of candidates on the ballot and then it actually uses all that information to determine the winner.

<div class="gray-box">
<br>
<strong>Honesty:</strong> Can the voter safely express their honest opinion on the ballot? Does the system encourage honest voting and discourage strategic voting? 
<br><br>
</div>

<p>Any voting system that discourages or punishes honest voting is fundamentally broken. If we as voters cannot honestly vote for who and what we believe in we are not in a democracy. Instant Runoff Voting proponents <a href="http://www.betterballotbenton.com/the-benefits">often make the inaccurate claim</a> that with IRV, "you can honestly rank candidates in order of choice without having to worry about how others will vote and who is more or less likely to win." In fact, you can only safely rank candidates honestly in IRV if your favorite either has no chance at all or is a very strong candidate. This video shows clearly how IRV suffers from a more general form of the vote-splitting spoiler effect:</p>

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtKAScORevQ

<p>In essence, IRV uses the full preference information of only some of the voters and "shadows" the subsequent preferences of voters who choose a frontrunner in first position. This shadow effect seriously disadvantages third party and lesser-known candidates.

<p>This IRV bias against third parties is confirmed in the countries that have adopted IRV as an election system. In Australia for example, <a href="http://rangevoting.org/TarrIrvSumm.html">RangeVoting.org found</a>, "examining all 564 statehouse and federal IRV seats we found only a single one occupied by a third party." 

<p>IRV advocates argue that Score Voting is vulnerable to 'bullet voting' – giving your favorite the highest score possible and giving everyone else a zero. This critique was taken to heart and was one of the reasons that we developed Score Runoff Voting. If Score Voting and Instant Runoff had a child it would be Score Runoff! We believe that adding in the second runoff round to Score Voting allows us to have all the advantages of both Score and IRV without the pitfalls of either. Bullet voting in SRV is bad strategy because if you favorites are eliminated your ballot still needs to show which finalist you prefer. Whoever has the higher score, even if its a 2 vs a 1, will have your full vote in the second and final round. Bullet voters risk having no vote at all in the finals. 

<p>Ultimately a crafty voter can use some amount of strategy in any voting system but the question is if there is actually a benefit to doing so and if that strategy is dishonest. Dishonest voting like we are forced to use in our current Plurality system might help us elect the lesser of two evils but it means that even if a majority of people actually prefer a 3rd party candidate they will never win because people are afraid to vote for them. This strategy is a democracy train wreck.

<p>In IRV if you list your honest preferences you might actually make it more likely that your least favorite wins, ironically. This came up during a recent IRV election in Burlington, Vermont, where if some conservative voters had just stayed home their second choice, a moderate, would have won. However, because of their votes the moderate was the first to be eliminated and the far left candidate won. This election result was bad enough that Instant Runoff Voting was actually repealed by voters the next election, which is tragic because Plurality voting is even worse than IRV by every measure. The Election Reform movement has a hard enough row to how as is is without risking those kinds of setbacks. If Burlington had kept IRV, the voters would have learned their lesson the hard way and taken up dishonest strategic voting in the future. We can do better! 

<p>In Score Runoff Voting when everyone votes honestly and fills ou thier ballot fully we are rewarded with the best possible results. Simply rank every candidate with a score that shows your relative support for each. If you don't know about a candidate just leave their row blank and you won't effect their average. Even if some people chose to vote strategically, (perhaps giving middle of the pack candidates higher or lower scores on the scale for various reasons,) these strategies tend to even out between voters. The overall quality of the election isn't compromised because these strategies are still fundamentally honest.  

<p><strong>It's Time For 2.0</strong>

<p>The need for true election reform is more apparent now than ever before, and the recent adoption of IRV in Benton County, OR and the state of Maine show that electorates on both coasts are ready for more expressive voting systems. What we need now is the upgraded version that actually gets rid of the spoiler effect once and for all. We need a strong system we can defend that isn't <a href="https://electology.org/irv-repealed">vulnerable to repeal after adoption</a> due to complexity of implementation and non-representative outcomes or encouraging dishonest voting.

<p>The American electorate is hungry for a real solution to our broken political system. We clearly need an election system that gives us all an equal say, accurately reflects our collective will in the outcome, is simple for us to ballot and for elections officials to tabulate, and that allows us to expressively share our honest opinions on the outcome. By all these measures, the new IRV - Score Runoff Voting - is the clear winner. 

<p>Oregon has <a href="reform">long history</a> of pioneering new, innovative reform proposals. The time is now to take up the mantle once again and <a href="srv#srv">blaze a new trail</a> to a better voting franchise.
