<p><strong>Instant Runoff Voting</strong><br><br>
Instant Runoff Voting, one of many forms of Ranked Choice Voting, is a system invented in 1871 that has been adopted (and in some cases repealed) in several large U.S. cities, the state of Maine, and is used in national elections elsewhere in the world. Instead of limiting the voter to the choice of a single candidate, or allowing the voter to score all the candidates like <a href="srv#srv">SRV</a>, IRV uses a preference order only ballot: first choice, second choice, third choice and so on.</p>

<p>If one candidate has a majority of the first choice votes, that candidate is the winner. Otherwise, the candidate who had the fewest first choice votes is eliminated, the votes of those who chose the eliminated candidate transfer to their next favorite candidate, and the whole process repeats.</p>

<p>Full rank ordering makes for a complex ballot - an NxN matrix to assign each candidate a rank position. In practice, IRV proponents advocate a limit of three or four choices on the ballot. An example ballot might look like this:

<p>In IRV, a voter who assigns the same rank to multiple candidates or multiple ranks to the same candidate spoils the ballot, and as more candidates enter the race, a voter's ability to express a meaningful opinion on the field diminishes.

<p>Score Runoff Voting has a <strong>more expressive, harder to spoil ballot, and a simpler counting process,</strong> such that the fundamental rules can be clearly communicated in two short sentences. SRV's ballot scales effectively to any number of candidates:

<p>The mechanism for tabulating IRV can remain opaque even for sophisticated voters. Steve Pond <a href="http://www.thewrap.com/awards/column-post/dont-believe-schmucks-24542/">wrote the following</a> about IRV after its adoption as the voting system for choosing Best Picture by the Motion Picture Academy: "A year and a half after the Academy went to a different system for counting Best Picture ballots, <strong>nominees and voters and campaigners still don't understand how it works.</strong> And it's driving me crazy."

<p>Because IRV's counting algorithm goes through one round for each losing candidate until a winner is decided, elections can take many rounds to compute. The image below represents a sample election vote tally in the multi-round IRV process. It's hard for observers and lay voters to draw meaningful conclusions about voter preferences from these intermediate results:

<p><strong>Score Runoff Voting is simple to tabulate</strong>. It is always completed in two rounds with transparent results that show overall popular support for every candidate. You can see the election results of the sample election run with SRV below:

Because a voter's second choice in IRV is never considered until her first choice is eliminated, IRV results tend to "shadow" support for lesser-known candidates. In the 2012 Manhattan exit poll study, Instant Runoff Voting and Score Voting were included in the alternative voting methods studied. Although the district is clearly not politically representative of the population as a whole, the following bar chart demonstrates quite clearly how the IRV shadow can hide public support for candidates other than the two frontrunners:<br>

<p>The winner of an IRV election cannot be tabulated until all ballot information is reported to a central location. Maine, which just passed IRV, is dealing with the <a href="http://www.pressherald.com/2016/11/11/logistics-could-put-ranked-choice-voting-on-hold-in-2018/">headaches of this system now</a>, expecting that "ballots would have to be shipped by town clerks to a central location in Augusta for additional voting rounds. Thus the outcome of an election in a multiple-candidate race might not be known for several weeks." Essentially, each town clerk has to come up with all of the many possible combinations of rank orderings and report the total for each, in order that the central counting authority can even begin the process to determine the winner. These partial results give very little direct meaningful information to the voters. A small subset of one election's partial results in IRV might look like this:</p>

<p><strong>Score Runoff Voting results can be summed by precinct</strong>, both the overall score as well as the preference totals for each candidate pair. This gives information that is useful in understanding how the local electorate felt about the election and makes the results easier to verify by hand-recount:
<p><img src="SRV_precinct.png" alt="SRV_precinct.png" /></p>

<p>Complexity would be a small price to pay if it produced an <a href="theequalvote#test">equal vote</a> amongst the voters, but <strong>IRV does not pass the test of balance</strong>. Further, because IRV uses the full preference information of only some of the voters and "shadows" the subsequent preferences of voters who choose a frontrunner in first position, it still suffers from a more generalized form of the spoiler effect: an honest vote for one's favorite candidate first can cause the election of the voter's least favorite candidate.

<p>Score Runoff Voting uses the overall value expression (scores) of the voters to determine the top two <strong>before</strong> using the voters' Ranked Choices in the runoff. This means you have minimal risk giving full support to your true favorite - if she makes it into the runoff, she is by definition a strong candidate.

<p>Finally, <strong>IRV doesn't come close</strong> to the top of the list in terms of creating outcomes that accurately match the will of the electorate. SRV, by contrast, is best in class for outcome accuracy. Learn more in the discussion of <a href="equal_systems_science">Voting Science</a>.

<p>We strongly encourage real world <a href="http://fairvote.org">organizations</a> and <a href="http://www.rcvoregon.org/">reform campaigns</a> considering various RCV options to note the significant delta between IRV and SRV.
