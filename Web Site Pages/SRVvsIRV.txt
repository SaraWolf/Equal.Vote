<p><strong>Instant Runoff Voting</strong><br><br>
Instant Runoff Voting, one of many forms of Ranked Choice Voting, is a system invented in 1871 that has been adopted (and in some cases repealed) in several large U.S. cities, the state of Maine, and is used in national elections elsewhere in the world. Instead of limiting the voter to the choice of a single candidate, or allowing the voter to score all the candidates like <a href="srv#srv">SRV</a>, IRV uses a preference order only ballot: first choice, second choice, third choice and so on.</p>

<p>To determine the winner, all of the first choice votes are counted. If one candidate has a majority, that candidate is the winner. Otherwise, the candidate who had the fewest first choice votes is eliminated, the votes of those who chose the eliminated candidate transfer to their next favorite candidate, and the whole process repeats.</p>

<p>Full rank ordering makes for a complex ballot - essentially a NxN matrix to assign each candidate a rank position. In practice, IRV proponents advocate a limit of three choices on the ballot. An example ballot might look like this:

<p>In IRV, a voter who assigns the same rank to multiple candidates or multiple ranks to the same candidate spoils the ballot. <strong>Score Runoff Voting has a more expressive, harder to spoil ballot, and a much simpler counting process,</strong> so much so that the fundamental rules can be clearly communicated in two short sentences. And SRV's ballot scales effectively to any number of candidates:

<p>The mechanism for tabulating IRV can remain opaque even for sophisticated voters. Steve Pond <a href="http://www.thewrap.com/awards/column-post/dont-believe-schmucks-24542/">wrote the following</a> about IRV after its adoption as the voting system for choosing Best Picture by the Motion Picture Academy: "A year and a half after the Academy went to a different system for counting Best Picture ballots, <strong>nominees and voters and campaigners still don't understand how it works.</strong> And it's driving me crazy."

<p>Because IRV's counting algorithm goes through one round for each losing candidate until a winner is decided, elections can take many rounds to compute. The image below represents a sample election vote tally in the multi-round IRV process. It's hard for observers and lay voters to draw meaningful conclusions about voter preferences from these intermediate results:

<p><strong>Score Runoff Voting is simple to tabulate and accurately shows overall popular support for every candidate.</strong> It is always completed in two rounds with transparent results. You can see the election results of the sample election run with SRV below:

Because a voter's second choice in IRV is never considered until her first choice is eliminated, IRV results tend to "shadow" support for lesser-known candidates. In the 2012 Manhattan exit poll study, Instant Runoff Voting and Score Voting were included in the alternative voting methods studied. The following bar chart demonstrates quite clearly how the IRV shadow can hide public support for candidates other than the two frontrunners:<br>

<p>The winner of an IRV election cannot be tabulated until all ballot information is reported to a central location. Maine, which just passed IRV, is dealing with the <a href="http://www.pressherald.com/2016/11/11/logistics-could-put-ranked-choice-voting-on-hold-in-2018/">headaches of this system now</a>, expecting that "ballots would have to be shipped by town clerks to a central location in Augusta for additional voting rounds. Thus the outcome of an election in a multiple-candidate race might not be known for several weeks." Essentially, each town clerk has to come up with all of the many possible combinations of ballots and report the count for each one, in order that the central counting authority can even begin the count. And these partial results give very little direct meaningful information to the voters. A small subset of one election's partial results in IRV might look like this:</p>

<p><strong>Score Runoff Voting results can be summed by precinct</strong>, both the overall score as well as the preference totals for each candidate pair. This gives information that is much more useful in understanding how the local electorate felt about the election, is considerably easier to hand-recount, and means much less data needs to be passed up for centralized counting. See below - both the candidates' scores as well as the voters' preferences on the field are discernible:

<p><strong>But what about the Spoiler Inequality?</strong></p>

<p>IRV's complexity would be a small price to pay if it produced an <a href="theequalvote#test">equal vote</a> amongst the voters. Unfortunately IRV fails on this count as well. Because it uses the full preference information of only some of the voters and "shadows" the subsequent preferences of voters who choose a frontrunner in first position, IRV still suffers from a more generalized form of the spoiler effect: an honest vote for one's favorite candidate first can cause the election of the voter's least favorite candidate. To see why this happens, check out the simple explanation in the video below:</p>

<p>Score Runoff Voting uses both the overall candidate value (score) <strong>and</strong> the Ranked Choice of the voters, so minimizes to a negligible value, Favorite Betrayal.

<p><strong>Finally, IRV just doesn't create an accurate outcome for the will of the electorate.</strong> SRV, on the other hand, is best in class for outcome accuracy. Learn more in the discussion of <a href="equal_systems_science">Voting Science</a>.

<p>So whenever you hear someone advocate the adoption of Ranked Choice Voting, make sure they're talking about Score Runoff Voting, not Instant Runoff Voting. We know it sounds like nerdy grognard nitpicking, but (see above) it makes a huge difference. We strongly encourage real world <a href="http://fairvote.org">organizations</a> and <a href="http://www.rcvoregon.org/">reform campaigns</a> that might still be on the fence about which one is better to take a clear look at the significant delta between IRV and SRV (see above).
