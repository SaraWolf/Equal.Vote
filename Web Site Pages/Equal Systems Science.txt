<p>The choice of a single favorite, known as Plurality Voting, is the simplest <strong>Ranked Choice</strong> system. Other Ranked Choice systems like Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) allow the voter to rank multiple candidates in preference order. It turns out that with more than two candidates, ranking systems fail the equality test and are provably "unfair." This is why SRV only uses the Ranked Choice of the voters in the automatic runoff.

<p><strong>Unequal.</strong> In rank-only ballot systems that don't require the voter to rank every candidate, the ballot itself is unequal, no matter the algorithm for computing the winner: it is impossible to construct <a href="theequalvote#test">balancing votes</a> for partial orderings of candidates. Ranked Choice implementations that fix the number of voter choices in each election are immediately unequal.</p>

<p><strong>"Unfair."</strong> Kenneth Arrow, PhD., won the Nobel Prize for actually proving that it is impossible to construct a fair rank order voting system when there are more than two candidates. No matter what algorithm is used to tally the individual rankings. This Impossibility Theorem depressed voting scientists for a half a century, for it was interpreted as proof that democracy is provably impossible.</p>

<p><strong>Rating Systems</strong> don't fall under Arrow's Theorem. In rating systems, voters give each option an independent measure of value, and each measure of value has a counterbalancing value: my yes to your no or zero stars to your five. Rating systems preserve the notion of equality of vote weight no matter how many candidates are in the race. 

<p id="manhattan"><strong>The Evidence.</strong> A 2012 exit poll study conducted in Manhattan&rsquo;s 69th Assembly District substantiates the claim that minor party candidates are unfairly marginalized by today&rsquo;s system. Participants in the study were asked to re-cast their presidential votes using Plurality Voting and a variety of alternate voting methods, including Approval Voting on each candidate. The results were striking:</p>

<p>Although the district is clearly not philosophically representative of the public as a whole, the single choice limitation empirically favors the two best-funded major party candidates. If voters are given the opportunity to rate each candidate equally and independently that all candidates will receive an accurate measure of voter support.</p>

<p><strong>The Science</strong>. This real-world data is backed by thorough election science analysis.</p>

<p>The field of decision science has advanced considerably in the 200+ years since the founding of the country. Princeton Mathematics PhD Warren Smith has <a href="http://scorevoting.net/StratHonMix.html">characterized more than 50 different voting systems</a>.</p>

<p>Dr. Smith measured voting systems by two key performance measures. First, its propensity to elect the so-called Condorcet Winner. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_criterion">Condorcet Winner</a> is the one who would beat every other candidate in a head-to-head contest. The second measure, <a href="http://rangevoting.org/BayRegDum.html">Bayesian Regret</a> is a more comprehensive measure of the overall satisfaction of the simulated electorate at the outcome of the election. Systems that maximize the number of Condorcet Winners and minimize the electorate's simulated regret with both honest and strategic voters are best.

<p>According to Dr. Smith's analysis, rating systems capture the top four spots as measured by <strong>both</strong> key performance measures of voting system efficacy.</p>

<p><a href="srvvsirv">Instant Runoff Voting</a> is at #42 on the list. #41 is the <a href="srvvstoptwo">Plurality Top Two</a>. Removing the single choice limit in the first phase vaults a Top Two from #41 to #2.

<p>It's the clue at the top of the list that shows the way to the full breakthrough: a two-phase, one-election hybrid of the Rating and Ranked Choice categories. Dr. Smith's simulations treated that best overall system as a two-election process, so election science researchers are now simulating it according to the one-election rules of Score Runoff Voting. Early results indicate it is among the best of all systems analyzed.
